# FallingSandSim
A simulation of elements.
## Plans for this?
I am going to start off with just a general physics simulation of different of elements, but I hope that over time I can take what I learn from making this game and attempt a Noita art style of game.
### Elements I want to add:
- [X] Basic AirElement
- [X] SandElement
- WaterElement
- DirtElement
- LavaElement
- WoodElement
- GunPowder Element
- SmokeElement
- Acid Element
