# FallingSandSim
A simulation of elements.
## Plans for this?
I am going to start off with just a general physics simulation of different of elements, but I hope that over time I can take what I learn from making this game and attempt a Noita art style of game.
### Elements I want to add:
- [X] Basic AirElement
- [X] SandElement
- [X] WaterElement
- [X] DirtElement
- [X] LavaElement
- WoodElement
- GunPowderElement
- [X] SmokeElement
- AcidElement

### Element variables I want to add
- [X] inertialResistance (Related to how likely the element is to fall 0-1f)
- [X] density (Related to what the element will float on 0-inf)
- [X] isFreeFalling (Related to falling calculations)
- [X] isRising (Related to rising calculations)
- [X] tempStrength (Related to how hot an element is)
- [X] burnChance (Related to how likely it is that a neighboring fire element will light it on fire)
- corrodeChance (Related to how likely it is that a neighboring acid element will corrode it away)
